# Annealed sequential Monte Carlo with multiple-try Metropolis kernel with application to SEIR-type disease transmission models

As a proposal kernel between intermediate distributions in the annealed sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC) algorithm, we use a multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) kernel which proposes from the entire collection of particles. The specific version of the MTM algorithm that this is based is introduced in Casarin et al. (2013)
